## Strategy: The Who and Why

This card game is primarily intended for someone who is already quite familiar with the casino game "Blackjack". It does include a link to a set of rules for newer players who are potentially interested in learning to play the game.

The idea of the game is for the player to reach the highest possible score in 5 minutes and compete with other players around the world for a spot on the leaderboard. The speed in which actions happen; such as cards being dealt and win/losses being shown is done to minimize the downtime and maximise speed of the game. Although mobile/tablet play is totally possible, the high-score freaks out there will favour playing on a laptop/desktop with a keyboard as keyboard shortcuts have also been added to help the speed agenda along.

As a player, I would seek to beat my own high score every time I play. I would also share the game with my friends to add to the competitive nature of the game. The high risk, high reward nature of any casino game drives this attention naturally.
